| Docker Configuration | ‚úÖ Complete | Docker environment supports both TypeScript and Python |
| Cross-Platform Script Runner | ‚úÖ Complete | Detects platform and runs appropriate scripts |
| PowerShell Wrapper Scripts | ‚úÖ Complete | Windows-specific scripts created for key functionality |
| MCP Server Docker Integration | ‚úÖ Complete | MCP servers run successfully in Docker |
| Windsurf IDE Integration | üü° In Progress | Basic implementation complete, testing needed |
| Documentation | üü° In Progress | Usage guides created, needs cross-platform testing |
| CI/CD Pipeline | ‚ùå Not Started | Need to add Windows testing to CI |

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. Docker Environment

- Enhanced Dockerfile with TypeScript and Python support
- Docker Compose configuration for service orchestration
- Port mapping for MCP servers (7865-7868)
- Volume mounting for code editing
- Environment variable passing between host and container

### 2. Cross-Platform Script Runner

- Platform detection for Windows, macOS, and Linux
- Script selection based on platform (.sh or .ps1)
- Docker fallback for Windows when native scripts unavailable
- Support for Docker container execution
- Command-line interface with help information

### 3. MCP Server Management

- Docker-based MCP server execution
- Networking configuration for cross-platform compatibility
- Script to copy MCP files to Docker container
- Adapters for GitHub and Coverage MCP
- Status checking and reporting

### 4. Windsurf IDE Integration

- AI provider abstraction layer
- Platform-specific provider selection
- Windsurf MCP configuration generator
- PowerShell scripts for Windows setup
- Documentation for Windows users

## Technical Details

### Docker Configuration

```yaml
services:
  docgen:
    build:
      context: ..
      dockerfile: .docker/Dockerfile
    volumes:
      - ..:/app
      - node_modules:/app/node_modules
      - python_cache:/root/.cache/pip
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=development
      - GITHUB_TOKEN=${GITHUB_TOKEN:-}
      - GITHUB_OWNER=${GITHUB_OWNER:-}
      - GITHUB_REPO=${GITHUB_REPO:-}
      - MCP_SERVER_PORT=7867
      - MCP_SERVER_HOST=0.0.0.0
      - COVERAGE_SERVER_PORT=7868
    ports:
      - "7865:7865"  # Coverage MCP
      - "7866:7866"  # GitHub MCP
      - "7867:7867"  # Coverage REST API
      - "7868:7868"  # GitHub REST API
    tty: true
    stdin_open: true
    networks:
      - docgen_network
```

### Cross-Platform Script Runner

The cross-platform script runner (`scripts/cross-platform.ts`) provides a unified interface for running scripts across platforms:

```javascript
function runPlatformScript(scriptBasePath, args) {
  // Check for platform-specific scripts
  const shScript = path.join(scriptDir, `${scriptBaseName}.sh`);
  const ps1Script = path.join(scriptDir, `${scriptBaseName}.ps1`);
  
  if (platform.isWindows) {
    // On Windows, try PowerShell script first
    if (fs.existsSync(ps1Script)) {
      // Run PowerShell script
    } else if (fs.existsSync(shScript)) {
      // Use Docker to run bash script
    }
  } else {
    // On Unix, use bash script
  }
}
```

### MCP Server Management

The MCP server management scripts have been enhanced to support Docker execution:

```bash
# Start MCP adapters in Docker
docker exec docker-docgen-1 bash -c "cd /app && MCP_LISTEN_INTERFACE=0.0.0.0 MCP_SERVER_HOST=0.0.0.0 /app/mcp-servers/docker-mcp-adapters.sh"
```

## Known Issues and Limitations

1. **Network Connectivity**: Docker networking requires careful configuration for MCP servers to be accessible from host
2. **Performance**: Running MCP servers in Docker adds slight latency to responses
3. **Windows Path Handling**: Windows paths need special handling when passed to Docker
4. **Environment Variables**: Environment variables need to be properly passed from host to container

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Windsurf Integration**: 
   - Finish implementation of AI provider abstraction
   - Test Windsurf integration on Windows

2. **Documentation**:
   - Complete cross-platform usage guide
   - Add troubleshooting section for common issues

3. **Testing**:
   - Test on Windows 10/11 with Docker Desktop
   - Test on macOS with Docker Desktop
   - Test on Linux with Docker

4. **CI/CD Pipeline**:
   - Add Windows testing to CI pipeline
   - Add Docker-based testing to CI pipeline

## Conclusion

The cross-platform Docker implementation for DocGen is well underway, with most key components already implemented. The Docker environment provides a consistent development experience across all platforms, and the cross-platform script runner ensures that users can work in ways that feel natural for their platform.

The MCP server integration with Docker enables AI-powered features to work across platforms, and the Windsurf IDE integration for Windows provides feature parity with Claude Code on macOS.

With some additional testing and documentation, this implementation will provide a robust cross-platform development experience for all DocGen users.
