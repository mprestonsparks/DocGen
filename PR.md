# Paper Architect Module Implementation

## Summary

This PR adds a new `paper_architect` module to DocGen that enables the systematic implementation of academic papers as software. The module analyzes papers, creates structured representations, generates executable specifications, and provides implementation guidance.

## Features

- **Paper Extraction Engine**: Extracts structured content from PDFs using GROBID
- **Knowledge Modeling System**: Creates formal representations of paper concepts
- **Executable Specification Generator**: Generates specifications that combine natural language with code
- **Traceability Matrix Builder**: Connects paper concepts to code implementations
- **Implementation Workflow Engine**: Guides the implementation process

## Implementation Details

- Added new project type `ACADEMIC_PAPER` to existing DocGen types
- Extended DocGen configuration with paper-specific document types
- Created a modular structure within `src/paper_architect/` with clean separation of concerns
- Added new CLI command `paper-architect` for working with academic papers
- Implemented bidirectional traceability between paper concepts and code implementations
- Added tests for the new module

## Usage

```bash
# Process a paper
npm run paper-architect -- -p path/to/paper.pdf -l python

# Update traceability with implemented code
npm run paper-architect -- -s SESSION_ID -t code-mapping.json
```

## Dependencies

- Uses existing DocGen infrastructure (config, logger, LLM, session management)
- Optionally integrates with GROBID for enhanced PDF extraction
- No additional npm dependencies were required

## Testing

- Added unit tests for the paper_architect module
- Implemented mock responses for external dependencies

## Documentation

- Added README.md file for the paper_architect module
- Created example code mapping file for demonstration
- Updated project documentation to include the new module

## Future Work

- Add support for LaTeX extraction
- Enhance the knowledge modeling with domain-specific ontologies
- Create visualizations for executable specifications
- Improve verification report generation
