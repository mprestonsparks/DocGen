# DocGen Implementation Plan

This document outlines the plan for addressing all open issues before beta testing DocGen.

## Issue Resolution Plan

### Phase 1: Monitoring Infrastructure (1 week)

1. **#18: Implement Systematic Monitoring for Incomplete Code**
   - Set up the base monitoring framework
   - Implement TODO comment analysis and reporting
   - Create automated tracking of implementation gaps

2. **#22: Review and Implement Monitoring System Documentation**
   - Complete documentation for the monitoring system
   - Update traceability matrix with monitoring components

3. **#21 & #20: MCP Servers Implementation**
   - Complete the GitHub Issues MCP server
   - Complete the Coverage Analysis MCP server
   - Set up integration between MCP servers and Claude Code

### Phase 2: Core Functionality Implementation (2 weeks)

1. **#12: Expand Paper Extraction Module**
   - Implement PDF extraction features
   - Add GROBID integration for structured data extraction
   - Complete JSON conversion utilities

2. **#13: Implement Knowledge Modeling Ontology Mapping**
   - Complete ontology mapping functionality
   - Implement term extraction and relationship modeling
   - Add knowledge graph generation features

3. **#14: Enhance Project Analyzer Component Extraction**
   - Improve AST analysis for component detection
   - Add framework-specific component extraction
   - Implement relationship mapping between components

4. **#15: Improve LLM Integration Reliability**
   - Add retry mechanisms and error handling
   - Implement fallback mechanisms between providers
   - Add token management and optimization

### Phase 3: Workflow and Validation (1 week)

1. **#16: Complete Workflow Implementation Module**
   - Implement full workflow management
   - Add progress tracking and reporting
   - Create workflow visualization tools

2. **#17: Enhance Validation System for Cross-References**
   - Complete cross-reference validation
   - Add document integrity checking
   - Implement automated correction suggestions

### Phase 4: Testing and Coverage Improvement (1 week)

1. **Address all coverage-improvement tagged issues**
   - Add comprehensive tests for all implemented features
   - Ensure >85% test coverage for all modules
   - Add integration tests for end-to-end workflows

2. **#19: Implementation Tracking: Core Functionality Completion**
   - Final verification of all implementation gaps
   - Close tracking issue when all implementations are complete

## Timeline

| Phase | Duration | Target Completion |
|-------|----------|-------------------|
| 1: Monitoring Infrastructure | 1 week | March 23, 2025 |
| 2: Core Functionality | 2 weeks | April 6, 2025 |
| 3: Workflow and Validation | 1 week | April 13, 2025 |
| 4: Testing and Coverage | 1 week | April 20, 2025 |

## Success Criteria

- All implementation-gap issues closed
- Test coverage >85% for all modules
- All monitoring-system issues resolved
- Automated tracking operational for any remaining TODOs
- Documentation updated to reflect all implementations

## Next Steps

1. Begin with Phase 1 implementation of monitoring infrastructure
2. Set up regular progress reviews at the end of each phase
3. Prepare for beta testing after successful completion of Phase 4
