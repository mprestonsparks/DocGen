npm run docker:exec node docgen.js init
```

This approach works on Windows, macOS, and Linux, and ensures all dependencies are properly installed.

#### Option 2: Native Installation (macOS/Linux)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/mprestonsparks/DocGen.git
cd DocGen

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your ANTHROPIC_API_KEY and other required variables

# Run the workflow manager
./docgen.js init
```

#### Option 3: Native Installation (Windows)

```powershell
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/mprestonsparks/DocGen.git
cd DocGen

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment variables
Copy-Item .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your ANTHROPIC_API_KEY and other required variables

# Run the workflow manager
.\get-to-work.ps1
```

## Usage Guide

### Docker-Based Usage (Recommended)

The recommended way to use DocGen is with Docker, which provides a consistent environment across all platforms:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/mprestonsparks/DocGen.git
cd DocGen

# Start the Docker environment
npm run docker:start

# Run the workflow manager inside Docker
npm run docker:exec node docgen.js init

# Run other commands
npm run docker:exec node docgen.js check-servers
npm run docker:exec node docgen.js start-servers
```

### Native Usage

For users who prefer to run DocGen natively:

#### Windows:

```powershell
# Start the DocGen workflow manager
.\get-to-work.ps1

# Run specific commands
.\get-to-work.ps1 check-servers
.\get-to-work.ps1 start-servers
.\get-to-work.ps1 check-tests
```

#### macOS/Linux:

```bash
# Start the DocGen workflow manager
./docgen.js init

# Run specific commands
./docgen.js check-servers
./docgen.js start-servers
./docgen.js check-tests
```

### NPM Scripts (All Platforms)

You can also use these npm scripts which work across all platforms:

```bash
# Initialize the development workflow
npm run docgen:init

# Check if MCP servers are running
npm run docgen:check-servers

# Start MCP servers
npm run docgen:start-servers
```

## Cross-Platform Development

DocGen is designed to work seamlessly across Windows, macOS, and Linux. Here's how it handles cross-platform compatibility:

### Docker-First Approach

The recommended way to use DocGen is through Docker, which provides a consistent environment across all platforms. This approach:

- Eliminates environment inconsistencies between platforms
- Ensures all dependencies are properly installed
- Simplifies setup for new users
- Provides consistent behavior across all platforms

### Platform-Specific Scripts

For users who prefer to run DocGen natively:

- **macOS/Linux**: Uses bash scripts (`.sh`) for native execution
- **Windows**: Uses PowerShell scripts (`.ps1`) for native execution
- **Cross-Platform**: The npm scripts automatically detect your platform and run the appropriate script

### Modular Architecture

DocGen now uses a modular architecture that separates core functionality from platform-specific features:

- **Core Modules**: Available to all developers regardless of platform
- **Claude-Specific Modules**: Optional modules that integrate with Claude Code
- **Platform-Specific Wrappers**: Ensure consistent experience across all platforms

### Unified Command Interface

The new `docgen.js` command interface provides a consistent way to interact with DocGen across all platforms:

```bash
# Initialize the development workflow
npm run docgen:init

# Check if MCP servers are running
npm run docgen:check-servers

# Start MCP servers
npm run docgen:start-servers

# Check test status
npm run docgen:check-tests

# Analyze project state
npm run docgen:analyze

# Toggle Claude features on/off
npm run docgen:toggle-claude
```

### Claude Code Integration (Optional)

DocGen can optionally integrate with Claude Code for enhanced AI capabilities:

```bash
# Enable Claude features
npm run docgen:toggle-claude

# Analyze project structure with Claude
npm run docgen:claude-analyze

# Generate documentation with Claude
npm run docgen:claude-docs

# Suggest test improvements with Claude
npm run docgen:claude-tests
```

### Multi-Language Support

DocGen is designed to work with multiple programming languages:

- **TypeScript/JavaScript**: Primary language for DocGen itself
- **Python**: Support for Python projects
- **Additional Languages**: Architecture designed for easy addition of more languages

For more details on the cross-platform strategy, see [docs/CROSS_PLATFORM_STRATEGY.md](docs/CROSS_PLATFORM_STRATEGY.md).

## Implementation Monitoring

DocGen includes a comprehensive monitoring system to track implementation completeness:

```bash
# Run the complete monitoring system
npm run monitor

# Basic TODO analysis
npm run validate-todos

# Enhanced semantic analysis
npm run validate-todos:enhanced

# Start MCP servers for advanced monitoring
npm run mcp:start
```

For more information, see the [Monitoring System Documentation](./docs/monitoring-system.md) and [Architecture](./docs/monitoring-system-architecture.md).

## Docker Support

For consistent development environments and easier team collaboration, DocGen provides Docker configuration:

```bash
# Build the Docker image
npm run docker:build

# Start the container
npm run docker:up

# Enter the container shell
npm run docker:shell

# Stop the container
npm run docker:down
```

These npm commands use Docker Compose to manage the containers. See the [Docker setup instructions](.docker/README.md) for more details.

## Template Structure

DocGen uses a structured approach to documentation:

1. **YAML Metadata Headers**: Version information, status, cross-references
2. **JSON Content Blocks**: Structured data with unique IDs for validation
3. **Markdown Content**: Rich text with cross-reference support

### Template System

The template system has a three-tier fallback mechanism:

1. **Primary Templates**: Handlebars templates in `docs/_templates/*.hbs`
2. **Fallback Templates**: Simple markdown templates in `docs/_templates/fallback/*.md`
3. **Dynamic Generation**: Automatic basic template creation if no templates are available

### Document Types

Documents generated include:
- **PRD**: Product Requirements Document
- **SRS**: Software Requirements Specification
- **SAD**: System Architecture Document
- **SDD**: Software Design Document
- **STP**: Software Test Plan
- **Swift-SDD**: Swift-specific Software Design Document (for iOS projects)

## GitHub Integration

DocGen works seamlessly with GitHub CLI for version control and CI/CD:

```bash
# Create a new project from DocGen template
gh repo create my-project-docs --template mprestonsparks/docgen

# Run documentation validation workflows
gh workflow run docs-ci.yml

# Release documentation (prompts for version type)
gh workflow run release-docs.yml
```

## Extending DocGen

DocGen is designed to be extensible:

1. **Custom Templates**: Add new templates in `docs/_templates/` using Handlebars (.hbs)
2. **New Document Types**: Extend the system with specialized documents for your domain
3. **Project Analyzer**: Enhance project analysis in `utils/project-analyzer.ts` for better detection
4. **Additional LLM Features**: Enhance the AI capabilities in `utils/llm.ts`
5. **Integration Guides**: Customize integration templates in `docs/_templates/integration-guide.hbs`

## AI Enhancement

DocGen uses the Anthropic Claude API to provide intelligent documentation assistance. When an API key is provided in your `.env` file, the following enhanced features are enabled:
