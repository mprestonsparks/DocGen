## Validation Rules

### Rule Structure

Each validation rule is defined with:

```json
{
  "id": "string",
  "name": "string",
  "description": "string",
  "category": "string",
  "severity": "enum(error, warning, info)",
  "applies_to": ["document_types"],
  "parameters": {
    "param1": "value",
    "param2": "value"
  },
  "message_template": "string",
  "remediation_guidance": "string"
}
```

### Example Rules

#### 1. Requirements Coverage Rule

```json
{
  "id": "REQ-COV-001",
  "name": "Requirements Coverage Check",
  "description": "Ensures all requirements from the Project Overview are covered in the Technical Requirements document",
  "category": "completeness",
  "severity": "error",
  "applies_to": ["technical-requirements.md"],
  "parameters": {
    "min_coverage_percent": 100,
    "source_document": "project-overview.md"
  },
  "message_template": "Requirement '{{requirement}}' from Project Overview is not covered in Technical Requirements",
  "remediation_guidance": "Add section addressing requirement '{{requirement}}' to the Technical Requirements document"
}
```

#### 2. Terminology Consistency Rule

```json
{
  "id": "TERM-CON-001",
  "name": "Terminology Consistency Check",
  "description": "Ensures consistent use of terminology across all documents",
  "category": "consistency",
  "severity": "warning",
  "applies_to": ["all"],
  "parameters": {
    "glossary_source": "glossary.md",
    "similarity_threshold": 0.85
  },
  "message_template": "Term '{{term}}' is used inconsistently across documents: '{{usage1}}' vs. '{{usage2}}'",
  "remediation_guidance": "Standardize terminology use according to the glossary definition"
}
```

#### 3. Cross-Reference Validation Rule

```json
{
  "id": "XREF-VAL-001",
  "name": "Cross-Reference Validation",
  "description": "Validates that all cross-references point to existing content",
  "category": "accuracy",
  "severity": "error",
  "applies_to": ["all"],
  "parameters": {
    "link_patterns": ["\\[.*?\\]\\(.*?\\)", "\\[\\[.*?\\]\\]"]
  },
  "message_template": "Cross-reference '{{reference}}' in '{{document}}' points to non-existent target",
  "remediation_guidance": "Update the reference to point to a valid target or create the missing content"
}
```

#### 4. Readability Analysis Rule

```json
{
  "id": "READ-ANL-001",
  "name": "Readability Analysis",
  "description": "Analyzes document readability using standard readability metrics",
  "category": "usability",
  "severity": "info",
  "applies_to": ["all"],

    "max_flesch_kincaid_level": 12,
    "max_sentence_length": 25,
    "min_readability_score": 50
  },
  "message_template": "Document readability score ({{score}}) is below threshold ({{threshold}})",
  "remediation_guidance": "Simplify language, shorten sentences, and use more common terms"
}
```

### Rule Implementation

Rules are implemented as JavaScript modules with a standard interface:

```javascript
/**
 * Terminology consistency validation rule
 * @param {Document} document - The document to validate
 * @param {Object} parameters - Rule parameters
 * @param {ValidationContext} context - Validation context
 * @returns {ValidationResult[]} - Validation results
 */
function validateTerminologyConsistency(document, parameters, context) {
  // Rule implementation
  const results = [];
  const glossary = context.getGlossary();
  
  // Find term usage in document
  const termUsages = findTermUsages(document, glossary);
  
  // Check for inconsistencies
  const inconsistencies = findInconsistencies(termUsages, parameters.similarity_threshold);
  
  // Create validation results
  for (const inconsistency of inconsistencies) {
    results.push({
      rule: "TERM-CON-001",
      severity: "warning",
      location: inconsistency.location,
      message: formatMessage(inconsistency, parameters.message_template),
      remediation: parameters.remediation_guidance
    });
  }
  
  return results;
}
```

## Validation Process

### 1. Document Collection

Gathers all documentation artifacts:

- Loads all markdown files from documentation directory
- Identifies document types based on filename or content
- Creates document metadata (creation date, version, author)
- Builds document relationship graph

### 2. Document Parsing

Processes documents into analyzable structure:

- Parses Markdown into structured representation
- Extracts headings, paragraphs, lists, and code blocks
- Identifies links, references, and citations
- Creates document object model for analysis

### 3. Rule Selection

Determines applicable rules:

- Selects rules based on document type
- Applies configuration-specified rules
- Considers document relationships
- Handles rule dependencies

### 4. Rule Execution

Applies validation rules:

- Executes rules in dependency order
- Collects validation results
- Handles rule failures gracefully
- Tracks performance and completion

### 5. Result Aggregation

Consolidates validation findings:

- Merges results from all rules
- Eliminates duplicates
- Prioritizes issues by severity
- Calculates quality metrics

### 6. Report Generation

Creates validation reports:

- Generates summary report with key metrics
- Produces detailed issue list with locations
- Creates visualization of validation results
- Provides remediation recommendations

## LLM Integration

The validation system leverages LLM capabilities for enhanced validation:

### 1. Semantic Analysis

Uses LLMs to analyze document meaning:

- Identifies semantic coverage of requirements
- Detects conceptual inconsistencies
- Evaluates completeness beyond keyword matching
- Assesses explanation quality and clarity

### 2. Gap Detection

Employs LLMs to find missing information:

- Identifies implied but undocumented requirements
- Detects missing context or explanations
- Finds incomplete logical flows
- Spots missing edge cases or scenarios

### 3. Quality Enhancement

Leverages LLMs for improvement suggestions:

- Recommends clarity improvements
- Suggests additional details where needed
- Proposes structure enhancements
- Identifies opportunities for better examples

### Example LLM Prompt for Gap Analysis

```
You are analyzing software documentation for completeness. I will provide you with:
1. A requirement from the Project Overview
2. The relevant section from the Technical Requirements document

Analyze whether the Technical Requirements document fully addresses the requirement. Consider:
- Whether all aspects of the requirement are addressed
- If implementation details are sufficiently specified
- Whether constraints and edge cases are covered
- If the requirement can be implemented based on the provided information

Requirement from Project Overview:
"{{requirement}}"

Relevant section from Technical Requirements:
"{{technical_section}}"

Provide your analysis in the following format:
- Completeness Score (0-100%): [score]
- Missing Aspects: [list any aspects not addressed]
- Improvement Suggestions: [specific recommendations]
```

## Reporting

### Report Types

The system generates various reports:

1. **Summary Report**: Overall quality metrics and key issues
2. **Detailed Violation Report**: Complete list of all violations
3. **Gap Analysis Report**: Identified missing information

### Report Formats

Reports are available in multiple formats:

- Markdown for human readability

5. **Overall Quality Score**: Composite of all metrics

### Visualization

Reports include visual representations:
