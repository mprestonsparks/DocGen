## Overview

This document outlines the testing strategy for the Documentation Template System, detailing the approach, methodologies, tools, and processes to ensure the quality and reliability of the system. The testing strategy covers all components of the system, including the interview process, LLM integration, document generation, and validation.

## Test Automation

### Unit and Integration Test Automation

```javascript
// Example unit test for template rendering
describe('Template Renderer', () => {
  it('should replace variables in templates', async () => {
    const renderer = new TemplateRenderer();
    const template = 'Hello {{name}}!';
    const data = { name: 'World' };
    
    const result = await renderer.render(template, data);
    
    expect(result).toBe('Hello World!');
  });
  
  it('should handle missing variables gracefully', async () => {
    const renderer = new TemplateRenderer();
    const template = 'Hello {{name}}!';
    const data = {};
    
    const result = await renderer.render(template, data);
    
    expect(result).toBe('Hello !');
  });
});
```

### E2E Test Automation

```javascript
// Example E2E test for CLI command
describe('CLI Initialize Command', () => {
  it('should start interview process', async () => {
    const { stdout, stderr, exitCode } = await execCommand('node bin/docs-cli.js init');
    
    expect(exitCode).toBe(0);
    expect(stdout).toContain('Welcome to the Documentation Template System');
    expect(stderr).toBe('');
  });
  
  it('should create session file after initialization', async () => {
    await execCommand('node bin/docs-cli.js init --project-name "Test Project"');
    
    const sessionExists = await fileExists('.docs-session.json');
    expect(sessionExists).toBe(true);
    
    const session = await readJsonFile('.docs-session.json');
    expect(session.projectName).toBe('Test Project');
  });
});
```

## Testing Challenges and Mitigation

### 1. LLM Determinism

**Challenge**: LLM outputs may vary even with identical inputs, making test assertions difficult.

**Mitigation**:
- Mock LLM responses in tests
- Test for content patterns rather than exact matches
- Use semantic similarity for assertions
- Snapshot testing with tolerance for variations

### 2. Template Complexity

**Challenge**: Complex templates with conditional logic are difficult to test comprehensively.

**Mitigation**:
- Break down templates into testable components
- Create test cases for each conditional path
- Use parameterized tests for variations
- Implement template linting for quality checks

### 3. CLI Interaction Testing

**Challenge**: Testing interactive CLI commands is challenging.

**Mitigation**:
- Use CLI testing libraries that support input simulation
- Create non-interactive modes for testing
- Test core logic separately from UI
- Implement detailed logging for test diagnostics

### 4. Test Performance

**Challenge**: Testing large document sets can be time-consuming.

**Mitigation**:
- Use representative samples for routine testing
- Run full performance tests in nightly builds
- Implement test parallelization
- Use fast test runners and efficient assertions
