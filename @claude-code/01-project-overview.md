# Documentation Template System Project Overview

Version: 1.0.0  
Last Updated: 2025-03-05  
Status: Planning Phase

## Project Vision

Create a comprehensive, LLM-powered documentation template system that automates the generation of high-quality software project planning documentation. The system will guide users through a structured interview process, generate appropriate documentation based on responses, and ensure consistency across all documents.

## Problem Statement

Software project planning documentation is often:
1. Inconsistent across documents
2. Missing critical information
3. Time-consuming to create
4. Difficult to maintain as requirements change
5. Not aligned with development workflows

Documentation gaps lead to misaligned expectations, development errors, and project delays. By providing an intelligent template system, we aim to standardize and automate the creation of comprehensive project documentation.

## Solution Approach

We propose a GitHub template repository with:

1. **Interactive Documentation Generation**
   - LLM-powered CLI interview system
   - Intelligent questions based on project type and technology stack
   - Automated document creation with consistent cross-references

2. **Smart Recommendation System**
   - Technology selection guidance based on project requirements
   - Framework-specific best practices integration
   - Performance metrics recommendations

3. **Documentation Validation & Management**
   - Automatic gap analysis
   - Version control integration
   - Consistency checking across documents

4. **Development Integration**
   - CI/CD compatibility
   - Code generation potential
   - Testing requirement traceability

## Key Objectives

1. **Reduce Documentation Creation Time**: Automate 80% of the documentation creation process
2. **Improve Documentation Quality**: Ensure 95% requirements coverage across all documents
3. **Enhance Consistency**: Maintain 100% terminology consistency across documents
4. **Enable Adaptability**: Support at least 5 different project types and technology stacks
5. **Facilitate Version Control**: Provide automated versioning and changelog generation

## Success Metrics

1. **Time Savings**: 75% reduction in time spent creating initial project documentation
2. **Completeness**: <5% gaps in documentation coverage (as measured by automated analysis)
3. **Consistency**: >95% terminology consistency across documents
4. **User Satisfaction**: >4.5/5 rating from users on documentation quality
5. **Adoption Rate**: >50% of new projects using the template system within 6 months

## Technology Stack

1. **Core Technologies**:
   - Node.js/Python for scripting
   - LLM API integration (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
   - Markdown as primary documentation format
   - YAML/JSON for configuration

2. **Integration Points**:
   - GitHub template repository
   - GitHub Actions for validation
   - LLM API for intelligence
   - Git for version control

## Timeline & Milestones

1. **Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)**
   - Template repository structure
   - Basic documentation templates
   - Initial CLI interview system

2. **Phase 2: Intelligence (Week 3-4)**
   - LLM integration
   - Technology recommendation system
   - Dynamic questioning flow

3. **Phase 3: Validation (Week 5-6)**
   - Document consistency checking
   - Gap analysis automation
   - Version control integration

4. **Phase 4: Integration & Refinement (Week 7-8)**
   - CI/CD integration
   - User feedback implementation
   - Performance optimization

## Development Approach

We will use Claude Code to implement this system in an iterative manner:

1. Start with core template files and structure
2. Add interview script functionality
3. Integrate LLM-powered intelligence
4. Implement validation and consistency checking
5. Refine based on testing and feedback

The system will be built with maintainability and extensibility as key design principles, allowing for future enhancements and adaptations to different project types.
