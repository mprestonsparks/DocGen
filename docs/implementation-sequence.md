# DocGen Implementation Sequence

This document outlines the optimal sequence for completing the remaining tasks to minimize redundant work.

## Task Sequence

### Phase 1: Complete Remaining Monitoring Infrastructure

1. **#21: Implement Custom MCP Servers for Development Enhancement**
   - Building on the foundation of the GitHub Issues MCP already started
   - Complete the Coverage Analysis MCP server
   - The MCP servers are relatively self-contained and don't have many upstream dependencies

2. **#20: Implement GitHub Issues Workflow for Claude Code**
   - This builds directly on the MCP servers from #21
   - Focuses on workflow integration rather than core server functionality

### Phase 2: Core Foundation Modules (Bottom-up Approach)

3. **#15: Improve LLM Integration Reliability**
   - The LLM module is a foundational component used by many other modules
   - Numerous other modules depend on the LLM module, so improving it first prevents rework
   - Adding retry mechanisms and error handling here will benefit all dependent modules

4. **#12: Expand Paper Extraction Module**
   - This is a lower-level component in the dependency chain
   - Other paper_architect modules depend on the extraction module
   - Implementing this early prevents needing to modify higher-level modules later

5. **#13: Implement Knowledge Modeling Ontology Mapping**
   - Builds on the paper extraction module
   - Used by the workflow and specifications modules
   - Should be implemented before those higher-level components

6. **#14: Enhance Project Analyzer Component Extraction**
   - The Project Analyzer is used by multiple components 
   - Enhancing it before working on dependent modules prevents rework

### Phase 3: Higher-Level Modules

7. **#16: Complete Workflow Implementation Module**
   - Depends on the LLM, extraction, and knowledge modules
   - Integrates with project analyzer
   - Should be implemented after its dependencies are complete

8. **#17: Enhance Validation System for Cross-References**
   - Validation is a cross-cutting concern that affects many components
   - Implementing it after the core functionality ensures it can validate all components
   - Changes to validation are less likely to require changes to other modules

### Final Phase: Integration and Verification

9. **#19: Implementation Tracking: Core Functionality Completion**
   - This is a verification task that should be completed last
   - It ensures all implementation gaps are addressed
   - Serves as a final checkpoint before beta testing

## Rationale

This sequence was determined through dependency analysis to minimize redundant work:

1. **Dependency-Based Ordering**: Starting with lower-level modules reduces the need to revisit completed tasks
2. **Foundational Components First**: LLM module improvements benefit all dependent modules
3. **Isolation Consideration**: Self-contained MCP servers provide immediate value
4. **Minimizing Integration Issues**: Bottom-up approach ensures integration points use completed components
5. **Progressive Testing**: Each module can be tested thoroughly as it's completed
