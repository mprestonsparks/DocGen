# Paper Architect Module for DocGen

## Overview

The `paper_architect` module extends DocGen to support the systematic implementation of academic papers as software. This module addresses the challenges of maintaining fidelity to research papers by providing tools for extraction, modeling, specification generation, and implementation guidance.

## Key Components

1. **Paper Extraction Engine**:
   - Extracts structured information from academic papers
   - Converts papers into a machine-readable format
   - Identifies algorithms, methods, equations, and key concepts

2. **Knowledge Modeling System**:
   - Creates formal representations of paper concepts
   - Maps relationships between concepts
   - Structures paper information using computer science ontologies

3. **Executable Specification Generator**:
   - Creates specifications that combine natural language descriptions with executable code
   - Enables verification through execution
   - Documents algorithms in human and machine-readable formats

4. **Traceability Matrix Builder**:
   - Establishes links between paper concepts and code implementations
   - Visualizes implementation completeness
   - Tracks development progress

5. **Implementation Workflow Engine**:
   - Guides bottom-up implementation approach
   - Creates staged implementation plans
   - Provides verification strategies

## Usage

### From the Command Line

```bash
# Process a paper and generate implementation artifacts
npm run paper-architect -- -p path/to/paper.pdf -o output/directory -l python

# Update traceability with implemented code
npm run paper-architect -- -s SESSION_ID -t code-elements.json
```

### Programmatically

```typescript
import * as paperArchitect from './paper_architect';

// Initialize paper implementation
const sessionId = await paperArchitect.initializePaperImplementation(
  'path/to/paper.pdf',
  {
    outputDirectory: 'output/directory',
    implementationLanguage: 'python',
    generateExecutableSpecs: true,
    generateImplementationPlan: true,
    generateTraceabilityMatrix: true
  }
);

// Get paper content
const paperContent = paperArchitect.getPaperContent(sessionId);

// Get knowledge model
const knowledgeGraph = paperArchitect.getKnowledgeModel(sessionId);

// Get implementation plan
const plan = paperArchitect.getImplementationPlan(sessionId);

// Update traceability with implemented code
const updatedMatrix = await paperArchitect.updateTraceabilityMatrix(
  sessionId,
  codeElementMappings
);

// Generate verification report
const report = await paperArchitect.generateVerificationReport(
  sessionId,
  testResults
);
```

## Implementation Workflow

1. **Paper Analysis**:
   - Process the paper with the extraction engine
   - Generate a knowledge graph of concepts and relationships
   - Identify key algorithms and methods

2. **Implementation Planning**:
   - Generate a bottom-up implementation plan
   - Identify dependencies between components
   - Create a staged approach for implementation

3. **Component Implementation**:
   - Follow the implementation plan
   - Start with foundation components
   - Implement core algorithms and methods
   - Update traceability as components are implemented

4. **Verification**:
   - Run tests against the executable specifications
   - Compare results with paper examples
   - Generate verification reports

## Code Traceability Format

When updating traceability with implemented code, provide a JSON file with mappings:

```json
[
  {
    "paperElementId": "algo-1",
    "codeElement": {
      "id": "class-kge",
      "type": "class",
      "name": "KnowledgeGraphExpander",
      "filePath": "src/algorithms/knowledge_graph.py",
      "lineNumbers": [10, 50]
    },
    "type": "implements",
    "confidence": 0.9,
    "notes": "Complete implementation of the algorithm"
  }
]
```

## Integration with DocGen

The Paper Architect module is designed to integrate deeply with the existing DocGen system:

- **Reuses DocGen Components**: Leverages existing document generation, session management, and validation systems
- **Extends DocGen's Data Models**: Adds paper-specific types while maintaining compatibility
- **Complements DocGen's Workflow**: Fits into the existing document generation paradigm
- **Maintains DocGen's Interface**: Uses consistent CLI patterns and API design

## Dependencies

- GROBID for PDF processing (optional, provides enhanced extraction)
- DocGen core utilities
