- `docs/reports/cross-platform-status.md` - Detailed implementation status

## Implementation Details

### Docker Environment

The Docker environment has been enhanced to support both TypeScript and Python development:

- Added Python 3 with key packages (networkx, matplotlib, requests, pytest)
- Configured volume mounting for seamless code editing
- Set up port forwarding for MCP servers (7865-7868)
- Implemented environment variable passing between host and container

### Cross-Platform Script Runner

Implemented a unified script runner that:

1. Detects the user's platform (Windows, macOS, Linux)
2. Selects the appropriate script format (.sh or .ps1)
3. Falls back to Docker execution when native scripts aren't available
4. Provides a consistent interface across all platforms

### MCP Server Integration

Enhanced the MCP server infrastructure to work in Docker:

1. Modified MCP servers to listen on all interfaces (0.0.0.0)
2. Created adapters for GitHub and Coverage MCPs
3. Implemented proxy scripts for communication between host and container
4. Added diagnostics and debugging utilities

### Next Steps

1. **Complete Windsurf Integration**: Implement AI provider abstraction and verify Windsurf configuration on Windows

2. **Improve Documentation**: Finalize cross-platform usage guide with troubleshooting information

3. **Expand Testing**: 
   - Test on Windows 10/11 with Docker Desktop
   - Test on macOS with varying configurations
   - Test on Linux distributions

4. **CI/CD Integration**:
   - Add Docker-based CI pipeline
   - Add Windows testing to GitHub Actions
