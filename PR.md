# Improved TypeScript Test Coverage and Module Mocking

## Summary
This PR enhances the test suite with TypeScript-compatible test patterns, converts JavaScript tests to TypeScript, and improves test coverage across several modules.

## Changes
- Converted JavaScript test files to TypeScript with proper type definitions
- Fixed module mocking to properly work with ES modules and TypeScript
- Added tests for previously uncovered functionality in utility modules
- Standardized test patterns across the codebase
- Added documentation for test patterns and best practices

## Test Coverage Improvements
- Expanded test coverage in validation.ts, llm.ts, and session.ts
- Added TypeScript type assertions to eliminate type errors in tests
- Fixed circular dependency issues in test mocks

## Future Work
- Continue improving test coverage for remaining modules
- Fix src-index.complete.test.ts issues
- Fix generator-reports.test.ts mock implementation

## Testing Done
All converted and added tests pass successfully with proper TypeScript validation.
