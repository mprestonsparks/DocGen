# Cross-Platform Docker Status Report

## Summary

The DocGen project now supports cross-platform operation through Docker integration, providing a consistent development environment across Windows, macOS, and Linux. The implementation includes platform detection, script selection based on OS, and Docker fallback mechanisms when native platform tools are unavailable.

## Implementation Details

### Platform Detection

- **macOS/Linux**: Uses bash scripts with `.sh` extension
- **Windows**: Uses PowerShell scripts with `.ps1` extension
- Fallback to Docker containers when platform-specific scripts are unavailable

### Docker Integration

- Docker configuration with volume mounting for development
- Cross-platform script wrapper that selects the appropriate script based on OS
- MCP server integration with Docker for consistent operation

### Script Organization

- `scripts/unix/` - Contains Unix-specific scripts (`.sh`)
- `scripts/windows/` - Contains Windows-specific scripts (`.ps1`)
- `scripts/cross-platform.sh` - Cross-platform script wrapper

## Current Status

### Working Features

- Platform detection for Windows, macOS, and Linux
- Script selection based on detected platform
- Docker container configuration
- Volume mounting for development
- MCP server configuration in Docker

### Known Issues

- TypeScript ESM module loading issues with cross-platform scripts
- Terminal output truncation with some commands
- Docker container requires additional testing on Windows

## Recommendations

1. Continue using JavaScript instead of TypeScript for cross-platform scripts
2. Add robust error handling for platform-specific failures
3. Test Docker integration on real Windows and Linux systems
4. Create complete documentation for cross-platform development workflow

## Next Steps

1. Verify Docker integration works on Windows
2. Test MCP servers in Docker on all platforms
3. Improve error handling for missing platform-specific scripts
4. Add Docker health checks to ensure container is properly running
