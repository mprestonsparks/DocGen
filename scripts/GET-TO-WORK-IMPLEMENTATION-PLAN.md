# GET-TO-WORK Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for a simple GET-TO-WORK script that demonstrates the three-phase workflow described in [GET-TO-WORK.md](./GET-TO-WORK.md). This script serves as a non-IDE alternative to directly using Windsurf's built-in Cascade AI with our MCP servers.

> **IMPLEMENTATION NOTE:**  
> The primary method for executing the "get-to-work" workflow will be through Windsurf's built-in Cascade AI using our MCP servers. This script is a supplementary tool for demonstration purposes and for use outside the Windsurf environment.

## Implementation Strategy

Following the DocGen project conventions:
- The script will be implemented in **Python** as it's a DevOps automation/system configuration tool
- The script will communicate with the MCP servers that provide the actual workflow capabilities
- No IDE plugins or extensions will be developed, as Windsurf already has native MCP integration

## 1. Script Architecture

### 1.1 Component Structure

```
/scripts
├── python/
│   ├── get_to_work.py           # Main script
│   ├── config.py                # Configuration management
│   ├── testing.py               # Testing phase implementation
│   ├── issues.py                # GitHub Issues phase implementation
│   ├── todos.py                 # TODO management implementation
│   ├── mcp_client.py            # Simple client for MCP server communication
│   └── utils.py                 # Common utilities
└── README.md                    # Documentation for script usage
```

### 1.2 Workflow Implementation

The GET-TO-WORK script will sequentially execute the three workflow phases:

1. **Testing Phase**
   - Discover and execute tests
   - Parse and display test results
   - Identify and report test failures

2. **Issues Phase**
   - List open GitHub issues
   - Analyze issue dependencies and prioritization
   - Report issues in priority order

3. **TODO Phase**
   - Scan codebase for TODO comments
   - Extract and categorize TODOs
   - Create GitHub issues for relevant TODOs

Each phase will primarily make API calls to the appropriate MCP servers, which contain the actual implementation logic.

## 2. MCP Server Integration

### 2.1 MCP Server Communication

The script will communicate with our Docker-based MCP servers:

1. **GitHub MCP Server**
   - Issue management operations
   - Repository metadata access
   - TODO-to-issue conversion

2. **Main MCP Server**
   - Test discovery and execution
   - Code analysis for TODOs
   - Context extraction and analysis

3. **Orchestrator MCP Server**
   - Workflow coordination
   - Cross-server operation orchestration

### 2.2 MCP Client Implementation

The MCP client will be a simple wrapper that:
1. Establishes connections to required MCP servers
2. Formats and sends requests according to MCP specifications
3. Handles responses and error conditions
4. Provides a clean API for the workflow phases

## 3. Implementation Plan

### 3.1 Phase 1: Basic Script Structure

1. **Core Framework**
   - Command-line interface setup
   - Configuration handling
   - MCP server connection management

2. **MCP Client Implementation**
   - Basic request/response handling
   - Authentication support
   - Error handling

### 3.2 Phase 2: Workflow Implementation

1. **Testing Phase Implementation**
   - Communicate with MCP servers for test discovery
   - Execute tests and display results
   - Process test failure information

2. **Issues Phase Implementation**
   - Retrieve and display GitHub issues
   - Present issue prioritization from MCP analysis
   - Display issue relationships

3. **TODO Phase Implementation**
   - Trigger MCP server scanning for TODOs
   - Display identified TODOs
   - Show TODO-to-issue conversion results

### 3.3 Phase 3: Refinement

1. **User Experience Improvements**
   - Add progress reporting
   - Improve result formatting
   - Add command-line options for customization

2. **Documentation**
   - Usage instructions
   - Configuration options
   - Examples for common workflows

3. **Testing**
   - Validate script functionality
   - Ensure proper MCP server communication
   - Verify workflow phases execute correctly

## 4. Dependencies and Requirements

1. **Python Dependencies**
   - requests: For HTTP communication with MCP servers
   - pyyaml: For configuration file handling
   - colorama: For terminal output formatting
   - click: For command-line interface

2. **External Requirements**
   - Running MCP servers (GitHub, Main, Orchestrator)
   - GitHub authentication credentials
   - Project repository access
