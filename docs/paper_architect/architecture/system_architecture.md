# System Architecture: `paper_architect`

## Overview

The `paper_architect` module follows a pipeline architecture designed to transform academic papers into structured software implementations while maintaining fidelity to the original research. This document describes the high-level architecture, component interactions, and data flow.

## Architectural Principles

1. **Research Fidelity**: The architecture prioritizes maintaining the integrity of the original research concepts
2. **Progressive Refinement**: Implementation proceeds from simple to complex, enabling validation at each stage
3. **Bidirectional Traceability**: All components maintain explicit links between paper concepts and code elements
4. **Executable Validation**: Specifications are executable to enable continuous verification against research

## Core Components

### 1. Paper Extraction Engine

**Purpose**: Convert academic papers from PDF/LaTeX into structured, machine-readable formats

**Key Components**:
- GROBID Integration
- XML to JSON Converter
- Paper Structure Analyzer

**Input**: Academic paper in PDF or LaTeX format
**Output**: Structured JSON representation of paper content

### 2. Knowledge Modeling System

**Purpose**: Create a formal representation of the paper's algorithms, methods, and data structures

**Key Components**:
- Concept Extractor
- Algorithm Identifier
- Method Definition Parser
- Computer Science Ontology Mapper

**Input**: Structured paper content
**Output**: Knowledge graph of paper concepts and their relationships

### 3. Executable Specification Generator

**Purpose**: Create specifications that combine natural language descriptions with executable code

**Key Components**:
- Markdown Template Generator
- Code Block Extractor
- Verification Fixture Generator

**Input**: Knowledge graph of paper concepts
**Output**: Executable markdown specifications

### 4. Traceability Matrix Builder

**Purpose**: Establish and maintain bidirectional links between paper concepts and code implementations

**Key Components**:
- Concept-Code Mapper
- Implementation Status Tracker
- Heat Map Visualizer

**Input**: Knowledge graph and executable specifications
**Output**: Traceability matrix and visualization

### 5. Implementation Workflow Engine

**Purpose**: Guide developers through a structured process for implementing papers

**Key Components**:
- Bottom-Up Implementation Planner
- Component Dependency Analyzer
- Progress Tracker

**Input**: Executable specifications and traceability matrix
**Output**: Step-by-step implementation guide

## Data Flow

1. The academic paper is processed by the Paper Extraction Engine, converting it to structured JSON
2. The Knowledge Modeling System analyzes the structured content to create a formal representation
3. The Executable Specification Generator creates specifications based on the knowledge model
4. The Traceability Matrix Builder establishes links between paper concepts and future code
5. The Implementation Workflow Engine guides the development process
6. As code is implemented, the Traceability Matrix is updated to track progress
7. Verification fixtures validate the implementation against the original paper

## Integration with DocGen

The `paper_architect` module integrates with DocGen's existing components:
- Documentation Generation: Enhanced to include executable specifications
- Planning Documentation: Extended to support academic paper implementation
- Traceability Matrix: Added to track paper-to-code relationships

## Technical Stack

- **PDF Processing**: GROBID (Java)
- **Knowledge Modeling**: Python with NetworkX
- **Executable Specifications**: Markdown with embedded Python
- **Visualization**: JavaScript/D3.js for heat maps
- **Workflow Engine**: Python

## Implementation Considerations

- **Scalability**: The architecture supports papers of varying complexity
- **Extensibility**: New algorithms and methods can be added to the knowledge model
- **Performance**: GROBID processing may require significant memory for large papers
- **Security**: Executed code blocks run in sandboxed environments

## Future Extensions

- Integration with automated theorem provers for formal verification
- Support for additional paper formats (HTML, Word)
- Learning system to improve concept extraction based on user feedback
