# DocGen: `paper_architect` Module

## Overview

The `paper_architect` module extends DocGen to support the systematic implementation of academic papers as software. This module addresses the challenges of maintaining fidelity to research papers while producing working software implementations.

## Key Features

- **Paper Extraction Pipeline**: Convert academic papers (PDF/LaTeX) into structured, machine-readable formats
- **Knowledge Modeling**: Create formal representations of algorithms, methods, and data structures described in papers
- **Executable Specifications**: Generate specifications that combine natural language descriptions with executable code
- **Bidirectional Traceability**: Maintain links between paper concepts and code implementations
- **Implementation Workflows**: Guide developers through a structured process for implementing papers
- **Verification Framework**: Validate that implementations correctly reflect the original research

## Architecture

The API module follows a pipeline architecture with four main stages:

1. **Paper Processing**: Extract structured content from academic papers
2. **Knowledge Representation**: Model the paper's concepts in a machine-readable format
3. **Documentation Generation**: Create executable specifications and implementation guides
4. **Verification System**: Validate implementation fidelity to the original research

## Usage with Claude Code

This module is specifically designed to work with Claude Code, enabling:

1. Initial paper analysis and understanding
2. Structured implementation planning
3. Code generation guided by paper specifications
4. Verification against the original research

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Set up GROBID for PDF processing:
   ```bash
   docker pull grobid/grobid:0.7.2
   docker run -t --rm -p 8070:8070 grobid/grobid:0.7.2
   ```

3. Initialize a new paper implementation:
   ```bash
   python -m docgen.paper_architect.init --paper="path/to/paper.pdf" --output="implementation_dir"
   ```

4. Follow the generated implementation guide with Claude Code

## Case Study: KnowledgeGraphExpander

This module was developed to address implementation challenges in the KnowledgeGraphExpander project, which aims to implement a complex knowledge graph expansion algorithm from academic research. The key insights from this experience are:

- Maintaining fidelity to the original paper requires structured traceability
- Implementation should follow a bottom-up approach, starting with core algorithms
- Architectural changes mid-implementation require special attention to preserve research fidelity
- Executable specifications enable continuous validation against the original research
