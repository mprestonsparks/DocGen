# DocGen Logs Directory

This directory contains log files generated by the DocGen system.

## Directory Structure

- `docgen.log` - Main application log file (specified in `.env`)
- `mcp-debug/` - Diagnostic logs for Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers
  - `github-auth.log` - GitHub authentication diagnostics
  - `coverage-github-auth.log` - Coverage analysis authentication diagnostics
  - `github-token-diagnostic.log` - Comprehensive GitHub token diagnostics

## Troubleshooting

When encountering issues with GitHub authentication or MCP servers, check these log files for detailed error information. The diagnostic logs provide insights into token validity, authentication attempts, and API responses.

For GitHub token issues, run the diagnostic tool:

```bash
node scripts/diagnose-github-token.cjs
```

This will perform comprehensive token validation and generate detailed logs in the `mcp-debug` directory.

## Retention Policy

Log files are automatically rotated when they reach 5MB in size, with a maximum of 5 historical files kept. This prevents excessive disk usage while maintaining sufficient history for troubleshooting.

*Note: Log files are excluded from git via .gitignore.*
