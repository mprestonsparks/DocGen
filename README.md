You are tasked with developing DocGen, a system for generating AI-optimized documentation using machine-readable templates. Review the provided documentation and implement the system according to these specifications:

Priority Documents (AI-Optimized Templates):
1. ai-prd.md - Product Requirements Document
2. ai-sad.md - System Architecture Document
3. ai-srs.md - Software Requirements Specification
4. ai-sdd.md - Software Design Document
5. ai-stp.md - Software Test Plan

These AI-optimized templates define the core structure and requirements using machine-readable formats with:
- Explicit YAML metadata headers
- JSON-structured content blocks
- Formal cross-referencing with unique IDs
- Traceability matrices
- Schema validation rules

Additional context is available in the numbered documentation files (01-* through 09-*), but the AI-optimized templates should take precedence in case of any conflicts.

Key Implementation Requirements:
1. Follow the directory structure defined in ai-sad.md
2. Implement all interfaces and components as specified
3. Ensure strict adherence to version requirements in ai-prd.md
4. Follow test coverage requirements from ai-stp.md
5. Maintain all cross-references and traceability defined in the templates

Development Priorities:
1. Machine-readable document generation
2. Schema validation and consistency checking
3. Cross-reference integrity
4. AI agent compatibility
5. Performance optimization

Please proceed with implementation, starting with the core template repository structure and basic document generation functionality.
