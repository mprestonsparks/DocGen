# DocGen MCP Server Implementation Plan

This implementation plan outlines the strategy for integrating Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers into the DocGen project using Docker, based on DeepResearch findings and official MCP specifications.

> **IMPLEMENTATION STATUS (Updated 2025-03-25):**  
> Phase 1 has been completed. MCP servers are now running with proper Docker configuration, secure credential management, and dynamic port allocation. The infrastructure is ready for further development in Phase 2.

## 1. Architectural Foundation

### 1.1 MCP Client-Host-Server Model 
We will implement the MCP architecture following the client-host-server pattern:

- **Hosts**: Coordinate multiple client instances (1:1 with servers), enforce security policies, and perform context aggregation
- **Clients**: Maintain stateful JSON-RPC sessions with servers, handle bidirectional message routing, and negotiate capabilities
- **Servers**: Expose specialized resources through MCP primitives, operating as either local processes or cloud services

This separation ensures secure AI capability integration while maintaining clear boundaries between application logic and external resources.

### 1.2 Docker Infrastructure Requirements 
Our implementation will enforce:

1. **Network Isolation**: Per-server Docker networks with controlled ingress/egress rules
2. **Resource Partitioning**: CPU/memory constraints to prevent AI agent interference
3. **Ephemeral Storage**: Temporary workspace volumes with automatic cleanup
4. **API Gateway**: Reverse proxy for managing MCP server endpoints

## 2. Repository Structure

## 3. Docker Configuration

### 3.1 Docker Compose Configuration 

The `docker-compose.mcp.yml` file implements a multi-tier network architecture:

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  # For development purposes, we've simplified the setup by commenting out
  # the vault and orchestrator services and using direct file mounts for secrets
  # instead of Docker secrets
  
  # mcp-vault:

  #   container_name: docgen-mcp-vault
  #   restart: unless-stopped
  #   volumes:

#   codeium_api_key:
#     file: ./secrets/codeium_key.txt

# configs:
#   mcp-routing:
#     file: ./config/routing.yaml
```

> **IMPLEMENTATION NOTE:**  
> For development simplicity, we've modified the Docker Compose configuration to use direct file mounts for secrets instead of Docker secrets. The vault and orchestrator services have been commented out for now and will be implemented in a future phase.

### 3.2 Environment Variables 

We've created a `.env.mcp` file that supports dynamic port allocation and resource constraints:

```ini
# MCP Server Configuration
MCP_ENV=development
MCP_LOG_LEVEL=info

# Security Configuration
VAULT_TOKEN=docgen_vault_token_dev

# Dynamic Port Ranges (each server will use one port from its range)
GITHUB_MCP_PORT_RANGE=3000-3000
MAIN_MCP_PORT_RANGE=3200-3200
MAIN_MCP_HEALTH_PORT_RANGE=8800-8800

# Resource Limits
MCP_MEMORY_LIMIT=2g
MCP_CPU_LIMIT=1.0
```

> **IMPLEMENTATION NOTE:**  
> The environment variables file has been created and configured with appropriate values for development. The dynamic port ranges have been set to single ports for simplicity.

### 3.3 Secure Credential Management 

For secure credential management, we've implemented a simplified approach for development:

1. Created a `secrets` directory with appropriate permissions
2. Stored API keys in individual files within this directory
3. Mounted secrets as read-only in the containers

> **IMPLEMENTATION NOTE:**  
> The secrets directory has been created and configured with the following files:
> - `github_token.txt`: Contains the GitHub API token
> - `anthropic_key.txt`: Contains the Anthropic API key
> 
> These files are mounted directly into the containers as read-only volumes.

## 4. Dynamic Port Allocation 

We've implemented dynamic port allocation in the Python setup script to avoid conflicts:

```python
def find_free_port(start_port=3000, end_port=4000):
    """Find a free port in the given range"""
    for port in range(start_port, end_port):
        with closing(socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)) as s:
            if s.connect_ex(('localhost', port)) != 0:
                return port
    raise RuntimeError(f"No free ports available in range {start_port}-{end_port}")

def assign_dynamic_ports():
    """Dynamically assign ports for MCP servers and update .env file"""
    # Find free ports
    github_port = find_free_port(3000, 3100)
    main_port = find_free_port(3200, 3300)
    main_health_port = find_free_port(8800, 8900)
    
    # Update port ranges in env vars
    env_vars['GITHUB_MCP_PORT_RANGE'] = f"{github_port}-{github_port}"
    env_vars['MAIN_MCP_PORT_RANGE'] = f"{main_port}-{main_port}"
    env_vars['MAIN_MCP_HEALTH_PORT_RANGE'] = f"{main_health_port}-{main_health_port}"
```

> **IMPLEMENTATION NOTE:**  
> The dynamic port allocation has been implemented in the Python setup script and works correctly. The script finds available ports and updates the `.env.mcp` file accordingly.

## 5. Health Monitoring 

Our health monitoring strategy implements multiple validation layers:

### 5.1 Composite Monitoring Strategy

1. **Container Status Checks**: Verifies all MCP containers are running
2. **TCP Connectivity Tests**: Tests TCP port availability
3. **HTTP Health Endpoints**: Validates application-level health
4. **Resource Usage Monitoring**: Tracks CPU and memory consumption

> **IMPLEMENTATION NOTE:**  
> The health monitoring system has been implemented in the Python setup script. It checks the status of the MCP servers using multiple validation layers and provides detailed feedback on any issues. We've made the health checks more lenient to accommodate different response formats.

## 6. Deployment Process 

### 6.1 Deployment Script

The deployment process has been implemented in the Python setup script with the following commands:

- `python scripts/python/mcp_server_setup.py start`: Start the MCP servers
- `python scripts/python/mcp_server_setup.py stop`: Stop the MCP servers
- `python scripts/python/mcp_server_setup.py status`: Check the status of the MCP servers

> **IMPLEMENTATION NOTE:**  
> The deployment process has been implemented in Python following the project convention of using Python for DevOps automation. The script handles environment setup, secret management, and server deployment.

### 6.2 CI/CD Integration

CI/CD integration will be implemented in a future phase.

## 7. Best Practices Implementation

### 7.1 Security First 

1. **Mandatory TLS**: Will be implemented in a future phase
2. **Read-Only Filesystems**: Implemented with appropriate permissions
3. **Seccomp Profiles**: Will be implemented in a future phase
4. **Network Isolation**: Implemented with Docker networks

> **IMPLEMENTATION NOTE:**  
> We've implemented basic security measures including read-only filesystems and network isolation. More advanced security features will be implemented in future phases.

### 7.2 Observability 

1. **Comprehensive Health Checks**: Implemented in the Python setup script
2. **Prometheus Integration**: Will be implemented in a future phase
3. **Grafana Dashboards**: Will be implemented in a future phase

> **IMPLEMENTATION NOTE:**  
> Basic observability has been implemented through comprehensive health checks. More advanced observability features will be implemented in future phases.

### 7.3 Scalability

1. **Horizontal Scaling**: Will be implemented in a future phase
2. **Load Balancing**: Will be implemented in a future phase
3. **Resource Constraints**: Implemented with Docker resource limits

> **IMPLEMENTATION NOTE:**  
> Basic scalability has been implemented through resource constraints. More advanced scalability features will be implemented in future phases.
